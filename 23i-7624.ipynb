    "Strengths and Weaknesses of Federated Learning\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy Preservation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength: FL allows model training without sharing raw data, preserving user privacy. This is particularly advantageous in applications dealing with sensitive data like healthcare.\n",
    "Decentralized Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength: FL enables training models across decentralized devices, accommodating diverse data sources and reflecting real-world scenarios.\n",
    "Reduced Communication Costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength: Communication mainly involves sharing model updates, reducing the amount of data transmitted compared to sending raw datasets centrally.\n",
    "Security Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength: FL's decentralized nature offers inherent security advantages, making it more robust against certain attacks compared to centralized training.\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: The need for frequent communication between devices can introduce latency and communication overhead, especially in scenarios with low-bandwidth or unreliable connections.\n",
    "Data Heterogeneity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: FL assumes that data across devices have similar distributions. Heterogeneity in data can lead to challenges in achieving model convergence and generalization.\n",
    "Potential for Model Poisoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: Federated Learning is susceptible to model poisoning attacks where maliciously crafted updates can compromise the integrity of the global model. Robust security measures are necessary.\n",
    "Complex Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: Implementing Federated Learning systems can be complex, requiring careful consideration of security, privacy, and communication aspects. This complexity can be a barrier to adoption.\n",
    "Limited Global Model Visibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: Due to the decentralized nature, there might be limited visibility into the global model's performance across all devices, making it challenging to monitor and improve the overall system.\n",
