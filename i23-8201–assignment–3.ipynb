This precision enhances the accuracy of pathology diagnoses, especially in scenarios with complex tissue compositions.\n","\n","Automated Segmentation for Efficiency:\n"," PathML excels in automating the segmentation process, efficiently delineating distinct regions within tissue samples. This automation significantly accelerates the workflow, allowing pathologists to focus on detailed analyses rather than manual segmentation.\n","\n","Adaptability to Diverse Tissues and Organs:\n","The adaptability of PathML to diverse tissue characteristics and organs is a notable strength. The model can learn and generalize from various datasets, ensuring consistent performance across different anatomical structures.\n","\n","Weaknesses of PathML:\n","\n","Dependency on Quality and Quantity of Data:\n","PathML's performance is contingent on the quality and quantity of training data. In scenarios where annotated datasets are limited or contain biases, the model may struggle to generalize effectively, impacting its accuracy.\n","\n","Computational Resource Intensity:\n","Training complex models like PathML can be computationally intensive, requiring substantial resources. This may pose a challenge for users with limited access to high-performance computing resources.\n","\n","Interpretability Challenges:\n","The interpretability of PathML's decision-making process might be challenging. Deep learning models often operate as \"black boxes,\" making it difficult to explain how specific decisions are reached, which could be a concern in critical medical contexts"],"metadata":{"id":"7lyiADnVqTxM"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4sUuiP0hcGl4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700918641973,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":70607,"user":{"displayName":"Nabeelah Maryam","userId":"17740057978794911146"}},"outputId":"f13577f0-5ced-4fab-e251-24f5b11cf6c9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting openslide-python\n","  Downloading openslide-python-1.3.1.tar.gz (358 kB)\n","\u001b[?25l     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/359.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[91m╸\u001b[0m\u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m112.6/359.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m359.0/359.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Requirement already satisfied: Pillow in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from openslide-python) (9.4.0)\n","Building wheels for collected packages: openslide-python\n","  Building wheel for openslide-python (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for openslide-python: filename=openslide_python-1.3.1-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl size=33550 sha256=2a0c5ba9256ecb8e1b6f07434c8055ec4e7b48a11530bedc1e25cab14da97ca5\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/79/79/fa/29a0087493c69dff7fd0b70fab5d6771002a531010161d2d97\n","Successfully built openslide-python\n","Installing collected packages: openslide-python\n","Successfully installed openslide-python-1.3.1\n","Reading package lists...
